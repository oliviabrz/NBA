# NBA

This project was built in collaboration with my mentor as part of my learning journey. We built a web application called NBA that displays various NBA statistics
of players, teams and games from the 2018, 2019, or 2020 season. It is built using Python and Flask for the backend, MySQL for the database, and Angular/Typescript for the frontend.
